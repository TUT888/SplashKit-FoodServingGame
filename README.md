## About Gameplay
The customer will randomly generate an order, which is a combination of food (Chips or Nuggets) and drinks (CocaCola or Coffee).

The player can move around the map, press `A` to interact with objects, pick up food and drinks, place them on a plate, and deliver the plate to the customer to earn money.

The player can only carry 1 type of food (in the left hand) and 1 type of drink (in the right hand), or a combination plate (in both hands).
If the player accidentally picks up the wrong object, they can press `D` near the bin to discard all objects they are holding.
